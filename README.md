# Description

In this repository, we are attempting to model Fungi network.


# Files


The file [parameter.ini](https://github.com/KhoiVo020/Fungi_network/blob/main/parameters.ini) is the initial set up and should be update for the growth condition.

The main file to run is the [driver_fujngalGrowthSingleNutrient.py](driver_fungalGrowth_singleNutrient.py) and should be updated the directory to the corresponding directory on your machine.
